    <h1>Game Rules😍: </h1>
    <p>

    <h2>
      1.Objective: The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 points or
      more.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      2.Rolling the Dice: On their turn, a player rolls a six-sided die. The number rolled determines the points
      earned
      for that turn.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      3.Scoring: If a player rolls a number other than 1, the number rolled is added to their current score. If a
      player
      rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      4.Holding Points: At any point during their turn, a player can choose to "hold," which adds their current
      score to
      their total score. The turn then passes to the next player.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      5.Winning: The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds 100 points. That player is declared the
      winner,
      and the game ends. If multiple players reach 100 points in the same round, the player with the highest total
      score wins.
